    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade spaghetti with meat sauce recipe is the type of dinner you can easily have at the ready thanks to a simply stocked pantry and a few foundation refrigerator ingredients I can always find at my local Smithâ€™s Marketplace / Kroger store.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>1 lb spaghetti pasta</li>
            <li>1 28-oz can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 to 3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh basil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>finishing olive oil</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make pasta: Heat a large pot of water, seasoned with salt, and bring to a boil. Cook the spaghetti to al dente. Reserve a cup of pasta water before draining. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prep the tomatoes: using a slotted spoon, remove the whole tomatoes from the can and into a bowl. Do not toss the tomato sauce in the can. We will use that later! I used a potato masher to crush the tomatoes; you can also use your fingers. Some people like to also remove the seeds from the tomatoes. I just left them there. Remove the seeds if you prefer. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a large skillet with high sides, or a Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until garlic is golden all over, for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed red pepper flakes and then add in the smashed tomatoes and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have darkened in color a bit, for about 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the reserved tomato liquid from the can and stir to combine. Season with a pinch of salt, add in the basil sprigs, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced and sauce is thick like applesauce, for about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in the cooked spaghetti, and using tongs, start tossing together constantly until the spaghetti is all nicely coated in the sauce. If you need it, add a just a little splash of the pasta cooking water. Add in the butter and toss some more until the butter is melted and incorporated.</li>
        <li>To serve: Divide the pasta into bowls. I have some finishing olive oil with a hint of lemon that I love. If you have a great tasting olive oil, lightly drizzle some over the top. Garnish with more crushed red pepper flakes if you'd like and some basil and enjoy! Obviously, if you have some freshly grated parmesan cheese, that would be amazing here as well.</li>
