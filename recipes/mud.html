                <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
                <li>1 cup suagr</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
                <li>1/4 cup flour</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat oven to 350F. Grease an 8x8 square pan or a 9x5 loaf pan or line with parchment or foil; set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, add the butter and microwave for 1 minute or until completely melted. Add the sugar and cocoa powder and whisk vigorously for at least a minute, until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
                <li>Add eggs one at a time then vanilla and whisk for at least 1 minute, until well combined and batter is shiny.</li>
                <li>Stir in flour and salt until the flour is fully combined. Be careful not to overmix mix.</li>
                <li>Fold in 1/2 cups chocolate chips</li>
                <li>pread in pan and bake for approximately 20 minutes or until the center is slightly set.  Be careful not to over-bake!</li>
                <li>Cool completely then cut into 9 large squares or 16 small squares ( I cut mine into 16)</li>
            </ol>
